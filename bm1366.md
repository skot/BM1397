# BM1366

## Prelude

Many registers described below are common with other BM13xx chips. Here we focus mainly on BM1366 as this register map has been reverse engineered from the 'bmminer' of S19XP-Hydro original Firmware from Bitmain.

## Set Baudrate

In order to get a higher hash rate, we need to increase the communication Baudrate because at 115200bps (default baudrate) a [Send Job](bm1366_protocol.md#send-job) Command with 4 midstate would take 15.2ms which could be longer than the time the full chain would take to Hash the complete Nonce space of the previous job.

`BaudRate = fBase / ((BT8D + 1) * 8)`

At chip reset, in [Fast UART Configuration](bm1366_registers.md#fast-uart-configuration) Register :

* [BCLK_SEL](bm1366_registers.md#bclk_sel) = 0 => fBase = fCLKI = 25MHz.

* [BT8D](bm1366_registers.md#bt8d) = 26 (0x1A)

So the default BaudRate = fCLKI / ((BT8D + 1) * 8) = 115740 bps with reset values (0.47% error with target 115200 bps).

This is possible up to 3.125Mbps BaudRate with [BT8D](bm1366_registers.md#bt8d) = 0.

For higher baud rates, here are the necessary steps (numeric example below is for 6.25 Mbps BaudRate):

1. enabling and configuring PLL1 using [PLL1 Parameter](bm1366_registers.md#pll1-parameter) for example writing 0xC0700111 will result of a PLL3 with frequency equal to `fPLL3 = fCLKI * FBDIV / (REFDIV * POSTDIV1 * POSTDIV2) = 25MHz*112/(1*1*1) = 2.8 GHz`
2. setting PLL1_DIV4 in [Fast UART Configuration](bm1366_registers.md#fast-uart-configuration) for example writing 0xTBD give a `PLL1_DIV4 = 6`
3. setting [BCLK_SEL](bm1366_registers.md#bclk_sel) to 1 `fBase = fPLL1 / (PLL1_DIV4 + 1) = 2.8 GHz / (6+1) = 400 MHz`
4. setting [BT8D](bm1366_registers.md#bt8d) to 7 `BaudRate = fBase / ((BT8D + 1)*8) = 400 MHz / ((7+1)*8) = 6.25 MBps`
